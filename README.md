# Furniture website powered by Django
Fully responsive website built with Django and other technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Deployment on Heroku.

## Information
Full version of website is also powered by Amazon Web Services for correctly working images. Project that I placed here is before deployment so it's including only basic code but it's enough to start adventures with Django and try understand it.

## Usage
First you have to create virtual environment. You can check the docs how to do it: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html but I would recommend install pipenv. 
If you don't know what it is go here: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv.

Next clone the repository by running in command line: 

```git 
https://github.com/Simply-man/website-wojtekmeble.pl.git
```

Clone it IN your venv folder!

Finally you can start your `virtual environment` then hit the command 

```python 
python manage.py runserver
``` 
and everything should work correctly. Congrats you did pretty well.

## Displaying Images
